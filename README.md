# Social Housing Corporation - Homepage Implementation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created as part of a frontend developer assessment. The task is to create a pixel-perfect, responsive implementation of a provided Figma design for the homepage of a social housing corporation.

## Project Overview

The goal is to translate the desktop design provided in the Figma file into a fully functional, responsive webpage. The implementation uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. The project focuses on maintaining the design's precision while ensuring a clear and maintainable project structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-housing-homepage.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd social-housing-homepage
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the homepage.

### File Structure

The project is organized with best practices in mind:

- `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
- `pages/`: Contains the main pages of the project, including `index.js` for the homepage.
- `styles/`: Contains global and component-specific styles.


## Approach to Responsiveness

The design provided in the Figma file was for the desktop version only. I implemented responsiveness by considering various screen sizes, including tablets and mobile devices. The following approach was used:

- **TailwindCSS Utilities:** Tailwind's responsive utility classes were extensively used to adapt the layout, typography, and spacing across different screen sizes.
- **Custom Media Queries:** Where necessary, custom media queries were used to handle specific breakpoints not covered by Tailwind's default utilities.

## Designer Feedback

If working directly with the designer, I would have the following questions/remarks:

- **Tablet and Mobile Designs:** The design provided is only for the desktop version. It would be helpful to have specific designs for tablet and mobile breakpoints to ensure alignment with the designer's vision.
- **Font Sizes and Spacing:** Clarification on font sizes, line heights, and spacing for smaller screens would ensure better consistency across devices.
- **Images and Icons:** Providing images and icons to be used would be great.
- **Interactivity Details:** Information on any interactive elements, such as hover states or transitions, would be useful to match the intended user experience.
